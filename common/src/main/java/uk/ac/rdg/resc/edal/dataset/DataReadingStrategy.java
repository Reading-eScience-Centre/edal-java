/**
 * <p>
 * Defines different strategies for reading data from files. The grid below
 * represents the source data. Black grid squares represent data points that
 * must be read from the source data and will be used to generate the final
 * output (e.g. image):
 * </p>
 * <img src="doc-files/pixelmap_pbp.png">
 * <p>
 * A variety of strategies are possible for reading these data points:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h3>Strategy 1: read data points one at a time</h3>
 * <p>
 * Read each data point individually by using {@link DomainMapper#iterator()} to
 * iterate over all {@link DomainMapperEntry}s and reading the appropriate
 * indices from {@link DomainMapperEntry#getTargetIndices()}.
 * 
 * This minimizes the memory footprint as the minimum amount of data is read
 * from disk. However, in general this method is inefficient as it maximizes the
 * overhead of the low-level data extraction code by making a large number of
 * small data extractions. This is the {@link #PIXEL_BY_PIXEL pixel-by-pixel}
 * strategy.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h3>Strategy 2: read all data points in one operation</h3>
 * <p>
 * Read all data in one operation (potentially including lots of data points
 * that are not needed) by finding the overall i-j bounding box with
 * {@link DomainMapper#getMinIIndex}, {@link DomainMapper#getMaxIIndex},
 * {@link DomainMapper#getMinJIndex} and {@link DomainMapper#getMaxJIndex}. This
 * minimizes the number of calls to low-level data extraction code, but may
 * result in a large memory footprint. The {@link DataReader} would then subset
 * this data array in-memory. This is the {@link #BOUNDING_BOX bounding-box}
 * strategy. This approach is recommended for remote datasets (e.g. on an
 * OPeNDAP server) and compressed datasets as it minimizes the overhead
 * associated with the individual data-reading operations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This approach is illustrated in the diagram below. Grey squares represent
 * data points that are read into memory but are discarded because they do not
 * form part of the final image:
 * </p>
 * <img src="doc-files/pixelmap_bbox.png">
 * 
 * <h3>Strategy 3: Read "scanlines" of data</h3>
 * <p>
 * A compromise strategy, which balances memory considerations against the
 * overhead of the low-level data extraction code, works as follows:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Iterate through each row (i.e. each j index) using the
 * {@link DomainMapper#scanlineIterator()} and
 * {@link Scanline#getSourceGridJIndex()}.</li>
 * <li>For each j index, extract data from the minimum to the maximum i index in
 * this row (a "scanline") using {@link DomainMapperEntry#getSourceGridIIndex()}
 * for the first and last entries in the row, since entries are sorted by
 * i-index (This assumes that the data are stored with the i dimension varying
 * fastest, meaning that the scanline represents contiguous data in the source
 * files.)</li>
 * </ol>
 * Therefore if there are 25 distinct j indices in the PixelMap there will be 25
 * individual calls to the low-level data extraction code. This algorithm has
 * been found to work well in a variety of situations although it may not always
 * be the most efficient. This is the {@link #SCANLINE scanline} strategy.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This approach is illustrated in the diagram below. There is now a much
 * smaller amount of "wasted data" (i.e. grey squares) than in Strategy 2, and
 * there are much fewer individual read operations than in Strategy 1.
